# Smart Agricultural Monitoring System

A full-stack application for a Smart Agricultural Monitoring System, using a Flask backend, MySQL database, and an HTML/CSS/JS frontend.

Predictive Coding for Compressing Sensor Data in Web-Based IoT Systems

This project focuses on developing a smart agricultural monitoring platform that efficiently collects and manages environmental data. The system uses predictive coding, a lossless data compression technique, to reduce the volume of sensor data transmitted over the network. Predictive coding improves bandwidth and energy efficiency by sending only prediction residuals (or small updates) rather than raw sensor streams while keeping full fidelity on the server-side decoder.

## Project Description

This project is a web application designed to monitor agricultural conditions. It uses a Python Flask backend to handle data, which is stored and managed in a MySQL database. The front-end is built with HTML/CSS/JavaScript and provides a simple dashboard for real-time visualization. Sensor data can be simulated locally for testing.

## Repository Description

A Smart Agricultural Monitoring System implementing predictive coding techniques to compress sensor telemetry (temperature, humidity, soil moisture). The application demonstrates real-time monitoring, database integration, and a lightweight API for ingesting compressed sensor data from IoT devices.

## Features

* Real-time Data Monitoring: Simulates sensor data for temperature, humidity, and soil moisture.
* Predictive Coding: Uses prediction-based compression for sensor payloads to reduce network usage while preserving lossless reconstruction on the server.
* Database Integration: Stores and retrieves data from a MySQL database.
* Web Interface: Displays data through a simple, user-friendly web page.
* API Endpoints: A RESTful API is provided to handle data from the sensors.

## Local Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/divineiosamor/agricultural-smart-monitoring-system.git
cd agricultural-smart-monitoring-system
```

2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up the MySQL Database:
* Ensure you have a MySQL server running.
* Execute the SQL commands in `mysql_setup.sql` to create the database and tables.
* Set up your database connection details as environment variables (e.g., DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME).

4. Run the Flask application:
```bash
python app.py
```

The application should now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## File Structure

* `app.py`: The main Flask application file, containing the backend logic and API routes.
* `index.html`: The main front-end file for the web interface.
* `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project.
* `Procfile`: Specifies the command to run the application on Render using Gunicorn.
* `mysql_setup.sql`: SQL script for creating the necessary database and tables.
* `simulate.py`: A script to simulate sensor data for testing purposes.
* `sensor_simulator.log`: Log file generated by the sensor simulator (if present).
* `smart_farm.log`: Main application log file (if present).

## Notes

* Removed previous unresolved merge markers and fixed the clone URL in the Local Setup section.
